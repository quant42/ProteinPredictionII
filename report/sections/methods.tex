\subsection{Dataset}

HypfuNN was developed as CAFA challenge~\citep{CAFA} entry competing against function prediction methods by other student groups. In order to compare the fitness of the implemented prediction methods, a common
dataset for training and testing for all groups was used, as described in the implementation part. The dataset contains 2815 HPO-annotated proteins. The HPO focuses on disease-related terms and is ordered hierarchical, e.g.~the term \textit{Renal insufficiency} can be refined as \textit{Acute renal failure} or \textit{Progressive renal insufficiency}.


\subsection{Implementation}

As already described above, we predict protein annotations by homology. Proteins that have the same function, so called homologs, tend to share a similar sequence. In order to identify proteins
with similar sequence, we are using blast and hhblits. For both blast and hhblits, we require an minimal e-value of 1, to exclude weak similar protein sequences. Our tool supports different blast e-values with the commandline option -e, as well as looking up similar proteins in other databases than our provided standard database with the commandline options -b for blast and -l for hhblits.

In order to map the annotations of the found proteins to the query sequence, our tool looks up the annotations for each found similar sequence hit. This step is done by an file that maps protein identifier to HPO terms. Our method supports the use of different mapping files with the commandline option -c.

Since HPO is a hierarchical annotation system, each found annotation implicitly represents a tree of more general terms. In order to merge these annotation trees, each node of each tree is annotated with information about the sequence hit. Hereby our method supports the peculiarity, that some HPO terms have more than a single parent node.

\caption{Performing the similarity search for a query sequence results in two hits. From the two hits, the two trees (A) and (B) can be constructed. Out of these two hit-trees, the tree (C) can be constructed by merging. Each node represents an annotation that is evaluated based on the nodes' summarized hit attributes and then accepted or discarded.}

\end{figure}
In order to predict whether a single annotation node can be transfered to the query sequence, we merge the found subtrees in one (Figure \ref{fig:function_transfer2}). By default, for the tree merging, all subtrees are taken into account. However when calling our method with the commandline option --fast, only the annotation trees for the best 6 hits (by e-value) will be merged.

Using the pyBrain toolkit~\citep{schaul2010}, we trained a neuronal network to recognize annotation nodes that may be transferred to the query sequence. For this step, the following features were taken into account:
\begin{itemize}
\item the length of the query sequence.
\item the number of hits that have/support this annotation.
\item the longest range length of all hits having this annotation.
\item the average range length of all hits having this annotation.
\item the best e-value of all hits having this annotation.
\item the average e-value of all hits having this annotation.
\item the product of the e-value from all hits having this annotation.
\item whether the hit with the best e-value was found by the blast or hhblits.
\item the minimum distance of the annotation to the annotation root.
\item the maximum distance of the annotation to the annotation root. (Since some root may have multiple parent nodes, this feature differs from the above feature.)
\item the percentage of the query sequence covered by hits having this annotation.
\item the length of the longest hit of all hits having this annotation.
\end{itemize}
The used neural network has an input node for each of the above mentioned features, as well as two hidden layers and two nodes in the output layer. The first hidden layer contains features + 1 nodes, while the second hidden layer
contains 3 nodes. The first output node predict whether we may transfer the given annotation to the query sequence. The second output node predicts whether we may not transfer the annotation.
The difference between the two output nodes is taken as the method's confidence.
