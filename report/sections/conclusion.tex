Homology based prediction is a standard technique in the bioinformatics community. Our predictor uses the hierarchical structure of the Human Phenotype Ontology to aggregate available information from different levels of the hierarchy. We try to improve over simple sequence similarity measures with a neural network designed to improve our functional predictions and add a measurable confidence to each prediction. Future research will hopefully be concentrated on optimizing the feature set and network architecture to improve training speed and prediction accuracy. We hope that our presented approach helps to understand and explore the possibilities and challenges that lie in the prediction of functional annotations.
